This blog is created to share some of my thoughts about new technologies and web developments. Hello My name is Hassan Azimi and I'm a software engineer and a web developer. I mainly work with PHP, Rails and Ruby applications but I look forward to any new technology about web applications and it doesn't matter if it is going to be JavaScript or Angular or any other web technology.

I own a website called [Parsclick](http://www.parsclick.net "parsclick"){: target="_blank"} which we teach people about the most useful programming languages.

> **Note:** [Parsclick](http://www.parsclick.net "parsclick"){: target="_blank"} teaches in [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language "Persian Language"){: target="_blank"}.

Beside computing I enjoy fitness a lot but I consider myself a geek. Because of programing, my job, fitness and Parsclick I literally have no time left, yes I'm super duper busy with this lifestyle and I enjoy it and because of that I have dropped a few people in my life. No I'm not a ditcher! I dropped them because they didn't understood me and specifically because there isn't much time left for me.

When I learn something and come across to the new subjects, I stop and sometimes I go to another subjects that related to the one I currently learning, and that takes days to learn and get out, when I get out, I will then remember that I had to learn the one I used to. Sometimes I say to myself: "all these new technologies are gonna take my entire career?". This is not only about being up-to-date but also in life.

I sleep 5 hours a day and although I know sometimes I need more than that but I can't do anything about it because somehow I enjoy staying up late, researching about new technologies. It's just I can't sleep! Sometimes I find no reason for sleeping but what can I do? I'm a human being and I get tired and I need to sleep.

If you visit my [twitter](//www.twitter.com/AmirHassanAzimi "AmirHassanAzimi Twitter"){: target="_blank"}, It's all about either coding or fitness. You might think I came here to know about this guy but all I read is about programming! That's right and it's because after I became a programmer I think better, I resolve problems faster, grow my mind better and challenge myself everyday in life. Trust me!

I speak 3 languages and I'm currently practicing French (hardest language of my life!) and I currently hold MSc in software engineering. The thing is when you get into this subject you must keep yourself up-to-date and I knew this even before I decide to become a software engineer. You don't know how fun is being up-to-date and learn new things.

People always ask me: 

> Why are you doing this for free? How do you earn money from it? Why don't you ask for money?
 
Well, money comes and goes isn't it? My parents taught me to always help people and give something back. That's why I always do that and I don't expect anything in return. The other reason is when I make tutorials I always repeat myself and that helps me learn as well and get better.  
Of course, money is needed in order to survive but it isn't everything. I hope you understand. 

That's it about me if you would like to know more about my work, skills, job enquiries and more, please head over to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hass0azimi "Hassan Azimi LinkedIn"){: target="_blank"} account.

I'm grateful.
